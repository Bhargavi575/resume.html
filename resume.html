<h3 >PROJECT</h3>
<h4 style=color:blue;>Research On Artificial Intelligence Deep Learning To Identify Plant Species</h4>
<p><h5>Nowadays, people pay more attention in artificial intelligence(AI) research, and they try 
to make Al smarter. The machine learning became a popular subject, especially in object 
recognition area. Aiming at providing a faster and more accurate plant species recognition 
program, the author introduced the deep learning and convolution neural network(CNN), 
and decided to build a CNN project with pycharm, anaconda, kera to find the best way to 
improve recognition program accuracy and recognition speed. The author tried to change the 
learning epoch time and learning data set capacity to found the best solution. After tests were 
finished, the result of output plots analyze is that both adding learning epochs time and 
extend training image set are all helpful to improve recognition accuracy and speed.
